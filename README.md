# Image Caption Generator:

This is implementation of a image caption generator from Yumi's Blog. which generates a caption based on the things that are present in the image
In this project Flicker8k(standard dataset) is used, and Captions are generated based the input features of the Image.

The preprocessing of Image is done my CNN and using VGG 16 Transfer Learning.

Flow of the project

a. Cleaning the caption data

b. Extracting features from images using VGG-16

c. Merging the captions and images

d. Building LSTM model for training

e. Predicting on test data

All the steps are executed in the notebook.




##Conclusion:

Successfully completed the project with good test results and great understanding.
